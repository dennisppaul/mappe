The people at [Novamondo](http://www.novamondo.de/) invited us to create this promotional video for their client [Netzwerk Neue Musik](http://www.netzwerkneuemusik.de/).

We used elements of Novamondoâ€™s corporate design to create a procedural, generative and sound reactive collage. The graphics react to a piece called 'First Interlude' by John Cage ( the sound in this video is left out due to copyright issues ).

We created programs that would analyse the music using a FFT algorithm. The generated data was mapped onto the behavior of graphical elements. Each frame was send to and rendered by [sunflow](http://sunflow.sourceforge.net/), a global illumination rendering engine.
