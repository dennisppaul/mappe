The [Tennisfreunde Berliin e.V.](https://web.archive.org/web/20131127104218/http://tennisfreundeberliin.de/index.html) was a society for the study of computer gaming as public experience. In temporary venues we transformed the game into an epicenter of public spectacle and reinterprete computer gaming as performance.

The project was conceived in collaboration with [Jakob Lehr](http://www.myhd.org/).
