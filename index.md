Hej,

Find below a Selection of works I have conceived over the years. Please also check out my studio for spatial, media-related design [The&nbsp;Product](https://web.archive.org/web/20150812070745/http://www.the-product.org/), or have a look at my [Curriculum&nbsp;Vitae](./curriculum-vitae/).

Since I am also frequently teaching, you might be interested in a [Selection of Student&nbsp;Works](https://digitalmedia-bremen.de/lecturer/prof-dennis-p-paul/) conceived in workshops and courses I taught, or maybe you want to learn something about my teaching activities as a professor for [Interaktion&nbsp;und&nbsp;Raum](http://interaktion-und-raum.hfk-bremen.de/) at [Hochschule&nbsp;für&nbsp;Künste&nbsp;Bremen](http://www.hfk-bremen.de/).
